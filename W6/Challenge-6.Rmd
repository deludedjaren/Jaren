## Questions
<br>

#### Question-1: Countdown Blastoff (While Loop)

Create a program that simulates a rocket launch countdown using a while loop. Start from 10 and countdown to "Blastoff!" with a one-second delay between each countdown number. Print a message when the rocket launches.

**Hint:** You may want to use `cat` command to print the countdown and `Sys.sleep` for incorporating the delay

**Solutions:**

```{r, eval=T,echo=TRUE}
# Enter code here

# Function to simulate a rocket launch countdown
countdown <- function() {
  count <- 10
  
  while (count >= 1) {
    cat("Countdown:", count, "\n")
    Sys.sleep(1)  # Pause for one second
    count <- count - 1
  }
  
  cat("Blastoff!\nRocket has launched!\n")
}

# Call the countdown function
countdown()


```

#### Question-2: Word Reverser (for Loop)

Develop a program that takes a user-entered word and uses a while loop to print the word's characters in reverse order. For example, if the user enters "hello," the program should print "olleh."

**Hint:** You may want to use `substr` command to access each character of the input word, and `paste` command to join the reversed letters one at a time

**Solutions:** 

```{r, eval=T,echo=TRUE}
# Enter code here

# Function to reverse a word using a while loop
reverse_word <- function() {
  # Prompt the user to enter a word
  word <- readline(prompt = "Enter a word: ")
  
  # Initialize variables
  length_word <- nchar(word)  # Get the length of the word
  reversed_word <- ""         # Initialize an empty string
  
  # Use a while loop to reverse the word
  while (length_word > 0) {
    reversed_word <- paste(reversed_word, substr(word, length_word, length_word), sep = "")
    length_word <- length_word - 1
  }
  
  # Print the reversed word
  cat("Reversed word:", reversed_word, "\n")
}

# Call the reverse_word function
reverse_word()

```
